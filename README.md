# RNO-G data used in publications
This repository holds a collection of data and plotting scripts used in publications. These data are made public to prevent the need to read off or grab datapoints from the published figures

## Directory structure
This repository is organised in subdirectories for different publications. Within the subdirectories, there may be the following directories and files:
* `data`: files (eg. `json`, `txt`) containing data points for plotting
* `plots`: (optional) output plots
* a set of plotting scripts generating `plots` from `data`.
* a `README.md` with more detailed description on the directory organization and publication reference details. 

For more details, refer to the README in the respective directory.

## Citation
Feel free to use the data provided in this repository. If you do so, please make sure to cite the paper this data belongs to.
